        description: "As you've seen earlier, I'm Pavan. I am from Sugar Land, Texas, one of the most diverse cities in the country. International concerts and fusion restaurants were the norm in my hometown. By growing up in such a diverse community, I learned about various different cultures and grew to be empathetic to others. As a result, my leadership style is very much influenced from the interesting connversations from my upbringing!",

        title: "So... why Computer Science?",
        description: "I got introduced to Computer Science through my mom, who works in Data analytics. In high school, I first learned Scratch, a visual programming language. My appreciation for the language led me to organizing my CS club's annual Scratch competition for elementary and middle schoolers. Next, I learned Java, which I used to excel in programming competitions in high school. As a result, I chose to major in Computer Science when I came to Texas A&M, and it was the best decision I have ever made!",

        description: "One thing I love to do is explore museums! My personal favorite is the Natural Science museum in Houston. In addition, listen and talk about music. If you want to hear my contrast between Sour and Blonde, please feel free to shoot me a text and I can annoy you nonstop. Finally, I love to get boba! It's not about the tea (well, it's kinda about the tea), but the social aspect of getting a Thai tea and catching up with a friend. If you're ever thirsty and need to vent about your life, meet me at Sharetea sometime!",
